This is an multiplayer game where you play in an arena with the goal to defeat the other players and remain the last man standing.
The arena shrinks by time and you can buy/upgrade spells to use against your opponents.
The game is using the same DirectX 11 renderar as the "Graphics Demo" project showcases.
